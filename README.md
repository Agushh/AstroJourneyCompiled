### 🧭 Overview

Astro Journey blends exploration, construction, and destruction mechanics within a procedurally generated universe. Inspired by games like **Minecraft**, **Terraria**, and **Starbound**, this project aims to deliver a free-form gameplay experience focused on player interaction and progression.

The game is currently in **Alpha** stage, developed by a single student, making it an ambitious project that just stopped.

### 🛠️ Development Status

Currently implemented features include:

- 🌍 Procedural terrain generation using fractal noise, creating smooth and diverse landscapes with long highlands and lowlands for a lively world.
- 🕳️ Procedural cave generation combining noise layers to control cave quantity and shapes (still subject to improvement).
- 🎨 Procedural texture generation using shaders with Voronoi algorithms to enrich block textures and avoid monotony. RuleTiles enable dynamic block connection.
- 💡 Dynamic lightmaps generated via custom shaders that overlay lighting effects per tile to add depth and graphical richness.
- 👾 Player mechanics featuring basic movement (left, right, jump) with animations and mouse directional facing.
- 🧱 Block building and destruction system.
- 🔦 Dynamic lighting.
- 💾 Local memory save/load system.
- 🎮 Animated UI menus.
- 🧰 Functional inventory and hotbar.
- ⚙️ Toggle between static and dynamic textures.
- ⏸️ Pause menu with control guide.
